# js-rss-to-social-post
A basic one pager with a bad name that looks at RSS feeds and creates markdown snippets to copy and post on social sites like Squabbles.io

### To run locally

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### To push to a live environment

Just move the /src folder where you want it. I am trying to keep it simple
